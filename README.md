# TodoList Website

Welcome to the TodoList Website repository! This project contains the code for a web application that allows users to create and manage todo lists. Users can add, delete, and organize tasks within different lists, making it easy to keep track of their tasks and stay organized.

## About the Website

The TodoList Website is built using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and EJS (Embedded JavaScript) for templating. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for managing todo lists. Let's explore the key features and functionality of the website:

- **Create Todo Lists**: Users can create multiple todo lists with custom names to organize their tasks according to different categories or priorities.

- **Add Tasks**: Within each todo list, users can add new tasks by entering a task description and clicking the "+" button.

- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks by clicking on the checkbox next to each task and then clicking the delete button.

- **Custom Lists**: Users can create custom todo lists by appending the list name to the URL. For example, "/work" creates a todo list named "Work".

- **Persistence**: Todo lists and tasks are stored in a MongoDB database, ensuring that users' data is persistent across sessions.

## Getting Started

To run the TodoList Website locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.

3. Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your machine.

4. Start the server by running `node app.js` or `npm start`.

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the TodoList Website.

## Customization

You can customize the TodoList Website in various ways, including:

- **Styling**: Modify the CSS styles in the `public` directory to change the appearance and layout of the website.

- **Functionality**: Extend the website with additional features such as task prioritization, due dates, or user authentication.

- **Localization**: Add support for multiple languages or regions to make the website accessible to a broader audience.
